        <div class="content">
            <p>The key differences are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Blackbook allows you to follow your favourite Trainers as well as
                    Dogs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blackbook will send you a daily email the night beforehand showing
                    all your scheduled favourite runners for the next day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blackbook can send you push notifications for when your favourite
                    runners are about to run.

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                No. Watchdog Blackbook will allow you to import your saved favourites
                from FastTrack eDog Tracker. This can be done from your Profile page,
                accessed through the profile button in the top right hand corner of
                the Watchdog App or desktop site. For more information on importing
