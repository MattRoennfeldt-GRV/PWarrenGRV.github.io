          Blackbook allows you to follow your favourite dogs AND trainers and
          receive a daily email summary of when your favourites are scheduled to
          run the next day. You can also configure Push Notifications to receive
          an alert when your favourites are about to run.

        As a FastTrack eDog Tracker user, do I have to find all my favourite
        Dogs again?
      </summary>
      <div class="content">
        <p>
          No. Watchdog Blackbook will allow you to import your saved favourites
          from FastTrack eDog Tracker. This can be done from your Profile page,
          accessed through the profile button in the top right hand corner of
          the Watchdog App or desktop site. For more information on importing
          your saved dogs, check out our
