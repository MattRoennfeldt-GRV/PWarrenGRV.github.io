            How is Blackbook different from FastTrackâ€™s eDog Tracker?
        </summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The key differences are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Blackbook allows you to follow your favourite Trainers as well as
                    Dogs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blackbook will send you a daily email the night beforehand showing
                    all your scheduled favourite runners for the next day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Blackbook can send you push notifications for when your favourite
                    runners are about to run.

            As a FastTrack eDog Tracker user, do I have to find all my favourite
            Dogs again?
        </summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                No. Watchdog Blackbook will allow you to import your saved favourites
                from FastTrack eDog Tracker. This can be done from your Profile page,
                accessed through the profile button in the top right hand corner of
                the Watchdog App or desktop site. For more information on importing
                your saved dogs, check out our

            How do I import my tracked dogs from FastTrack eDog Tracker?
        </summary>
        <div class="content">
            <p>
                You can import from your account profile page in Watchdog, which will ask for you to enter your FastTrack login information - either your FastTrack Member Number or the email you used to create your account with FastTrack and your FastTrack password.</p>
            <p>
                To begin, simply open your profile page in Watchdog and tap on the Start button in the Import section of the page:</p>

            I already have dogs in my Blackbook, can I still import from FastTrack?

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Yes. The import will only import dogs you were following in eDog tracker that are not already in your Blackbook.</p>
